    "The variable students is first created as an empty dictionary. An indexing operation creates a new entry in students with the key 'Jose' and the value of another dictionary. Indexing operations can be applied to the nested dictionary by using consecutive sets of brackets []: The expression students['Jose']['Grade'] first obtains the value of the key 'Jose' from students, yielding the nested dictionary. The second set of brackets indexes into the nested dictionary, retrieving the value of the key 'Grade'.\n",

    "Nested dictionaries also serve as a simple but powerful data structure. A data structure is a method of organizing data in a logical and coherent fashion. Actually, container objects like lists and dicts are already a form of a data structure, but nesting such containers provides a programmer with much more flexibility in the way that the data can be organized. Consider the simple example below that implements a gradebook using nested dictionaries to organize students and grades.\n"
