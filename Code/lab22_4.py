"""22.4 LAB: Output range with increment of 5.

Write a program whose input is two integers.
Output the first integer and subsequent increments of 5
as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:
-15
10

the output is:
-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 

Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:
20
5

the output is:
Second integer can't be less than the first.
For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last.
