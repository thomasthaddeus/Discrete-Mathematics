22.4 LAB: Output range with increment of 5

Write a program whose input is two integers. Output the first integer and subsequent increments of 5 as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:

-15
10

the output is:

-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 

Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:

20
5

the output is:

Second integer can't be less than the first.

For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last.
