    "A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The year must be divisible by 4\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400\n",
