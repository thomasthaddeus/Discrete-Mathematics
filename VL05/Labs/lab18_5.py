18.5 LAB: Palindrome

A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is the same when read both forward and backward. Examples are: "bob," "sees," or "never odd or even" (ignoring spaces). Write a program whose input is a word or phrase, and that outputs whether the input is a palindrome.

Ex: If the input is:

bob

the output is:

bob is a palindrome

Ex: If the input is:

bobby

the output is:

bobby is not a palindrome

Hint: Start by removing spaces. Then check if a string is equivalent to its reverse.
